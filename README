MKDI -- MaKe Docker Images
==========================

These tools provide means to build docker images in other ways that the
'Dockerfile' method.

Oldest alternative in 'mkdi/' uses docker run/.../docker commit to
create the images. This was pretty versatile, but it grew somewhat
complex and using multiple files started to look less intuitive.

Fast forward 20 months, the 'mkdokkrfile/' implementation preprocesses
"source" files to Dockerfiles. This brings convenience creating those
'RUN' blocks, and w/ makefiles the output image name gets defined in
process... just that 20 months is time long enough to forget the
things `docker build` just cannot do...

So, immediate successor of that is this 'mkdibuild.pm'. It gives
the versatility of 'mkdi/', (uses docker run/.../docker commit method)
and a build of multiple image layers can be handled in one file
requiring 'mkdibuild.pm' in its content.

This `mkdibuild` is implemented in perl(1). The idea is to keep it as
simple as is possible, so that it is easier to concentrate on perl's
strengths than its weaknesses. Doing the same things writing perl
code that can be done in Dockerfile doesn't require any more skills
than is required to write Dockerfile, and the example file
'mkdi-example.pl' shows these options pretty well.
