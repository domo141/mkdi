mkdokkrfile -- preprosessor to create Dockerfile for DEVELOPMENT work

mkdokkrfile.pl takes input files whose names end with '.src' and
preprocesses those to create files ending with '.out'.

The output files are suitable as input for `docker build`.

mkdokkrfile.pl provides the following features:

  - use variables/macros in the source file
  - include other files for content
  - create RUN sections easier
  - skip parts of a source file
  - end processing of a source file

These features ease creation of DEVELOPMENT docker container images,
in my opinion creating production images should be done a bit
differently, for example:

  - create final filesystem image tarball at the end of `docker build`
    process, and then use `docker import` to create image from that.

  - start a container from good base docker image (one which doesn't
    have anything extra), modify it and then use `docker commit` to
    create image from that.

Look into Dockerfile.1.src to see what kind of content mkdokkrfile.pl
accepts as input.

Run `./mkdokkrfile.pl Dockerfile.1.src` to create `Dockerfile.1.out`,
then inspect how the output file looks like.

Glance through `./mkdokkrfile.pl` to see how all of this work
(for nitty gritty details -- if needed).

Finally, execute `[sudo] make testimage1` to get first docker image
created using the dockerfile just created.
